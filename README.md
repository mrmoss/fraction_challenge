# Challenge

This is a simple challenge that does fraction based arithmetic.

Parts of this are done for the sake of the challenge (ex: gcd and fractional math).

There are modules that do all of this...but it seemed like cheating.

Could refactor into several class files and make a module...
but this is such a small program that I think it'd just complicate things.

## Requirements

Coding Challenge

Write a command line program in the language of your choice that will take operations on fractions
as an input and produce a fractional result.

- Legal operators shall be *, /, +, - (multiply, divide, add, subtract)
- Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces
- Mixed numbers will be represented by whole_numerator/denominator. e.g. "3_1/4"
- Improper fractions and whole numbers are also allowed as operands

Example run:

    ? 1/2 * 3_3/4
    = 1_7/8
    ? 2_3/8 + 9/8
    = 3_1/2

## Running

`./challenge.py`

## Todo

- Probably should have a whole lot more unit tests...
